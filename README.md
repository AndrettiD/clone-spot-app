Spotify Clone 

This Is a clone of Spotify. Accessing Spotify APIs to collect a user's playlist and user name and avatar. 
I also use Spotify to do the authorization for login into the app. 

I did enjoy creating this clone. It helped me get a better understanding of React. 

Tecknologies used for this:
    react, 
    react-dom, 
    react-scripts, 
    spotify-web-api-js, 
    web-vitals, 
    express, 
    mongoose, 
   @material-ui and @testing-librarys 

Future plan is to play tracks from the playlists. And to create a stand-alone media player.
